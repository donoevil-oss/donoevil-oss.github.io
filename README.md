# Do No Evil OSS Pledge

As an [Open Source Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) developer, whenever I link to this site from a specific repository I am pledging that I:

* Will **NOT** deliberately change that repository to do anything that could knowingly cause harm to its users
* Will **NOT** deliberately accept 3rd party contributions that I know may cause harm to its users.
* Will **NOT** deliberately hand over control of the repository to anyone I know intents harm to its users.

### Caveats

* This is **not** a legally binding document
* This does not change or modify the License under which the repository is released
* It does not give any assurances as to the support or development time I am able to give to the repository

### Why is this necessary

* This site has been created as a result of a set of high profile cases in which developers have not followed the above principles
* It is analogous to the historic doctorâ€™s [Hippocratic Oath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath)

### Contribute

* To help improve this site please go to the repository [https://github.com/donoevil-oss/donoevil-oss.github.io/](https://github.com/donoevil-oss/donoevil-oss.github.io/) and submit a PR or join the [discussions](https://github.com/donoevil-oss/donoevil-oss.github.io/discussions/).
* To add your name to the list of individuals who support this pledge submit a PR to update the [individual-supporters.md](https://github.com/donoevil-oss/donoevil-oss.github.io/blob/main/individual-supporters.md) file.
* To add an organisation to the list of those which support this pledge please raise an issue with a suitable official contact email address.

### Notes

* This is has been thrown together quickly - please help improve it!
* Badges suitable for linking to this page will be added once its a bit more mature.
* A good logo for this site would be much appreciated.
* [http://donoevil-oss.org](http://donoevil-oss.org) will link to this page once DNS has finished updating ...
